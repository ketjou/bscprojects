## EFFECTS OF NORDIC WALKING (NW) AND POWER TYPE TRAINING (RT) TO ADIPOKINES IN BLOOD 

Overweight and obesity are emerging as a significant health problem in Finnish society. Obesity 
and related risks have been identified and one of the major targets of interest is adipokines.
Adipokines are produced by adipocytes in adipose tissue. Adipokines regulate i.a. appetite and 
metabolism.

The study material used in this bachelor s thesis was collected from the NowaStep-study blood 
samples (n = 234) and analyzes were carried out during the spring of 2009 with xMAP and 
ELISA methods.

The purpose of this thesis was to find out how the 12-week controlled exercise affects level of 
adipokines (adiponectin, chemerin, HMW, leptin, RBP4). The aim of this bachelor s thesis was 
to gain further clarity on the relation between various adipokines and obesity and also to find out 
how adipokine levels change in context with controlled exercise. These results also help to 
compare effects of different modes of exercise (aerobic and anaerobic) on the adipokines.
Both types of exercise decreased significantly serum chemerin concentrations compared to 
control group. In addition, plasma leptin concentration decreased in the NW group. There were 
no changes in the circulating adiponectin, HMW and RPB-4 concentrations. Nordic Walking 
decreased body fat % and improved aerobic performance compared to RT and control group 
and BMI compared to control group.

Progressively structured aerobic training decreased significantly serum leptin concentrations 
after 12 weeks intervention program in pre-diabetic middle-aged men and both types of exercise 
had regulatory effects on circulating chemerin.
